<div class= "box"> <h1> Anatomy of a cherub backpack </h1>

<p>Metamorphosis! A cherub has three identities: a <a href="#student">student</a>, a <a href="#reporter">reporter</a> and a 
<a href="#weekender">weekender</a>. Each identity requires different provisions—different bags filled with different things.  A student mostly spends his or her time on campus, attending lectures and workshops. But sometimes, the student is given a task off campus in downtown Evanston, where he or she must take on the role of an on-site reporter. Afterwards, when all the hectic academic work is done, the cherub enters the last stage: a weekender. And the weekly cycle continues for five weeks. </p>

<p>As a student, you must be prepared with the right supplies and mindset. Know the schedule ahead of time and plan accordingly for the various lectures and workshops. Also, don’t forget to fill your backpack with little goodies that’ll help you stay awake and organized.</p>

<p> With a multitude of assignments, a reporter must be prepared for anything, anywhere. Be observant of your surroundings and look for the best interviewees. But don’t be discouraged after a rejection—just pick yourself up and keep trying. Also, don’t forget to use your gadgets and gizmos to your aid. </p>

<p> Aside from a 20-minute instructor meeting in the morning, weekends are typically free for a cherub to explore the streets of Evanston. With a wide variety of restaurants and shops, the possibilities are endless. Enjoy the five weekends you have away from the stack of assignments and savor what summer is supposed to be like. </p>
